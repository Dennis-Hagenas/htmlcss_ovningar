 Development on a Top Gun sequel was announced in 2010 by Paramount Pictures. Cruise, along with producer
 Jerry Bruckheimer and director Tony Scott, were asked to return. Craig wrote a draft of the screenplay 
 in 2012, but the project stalled when Scott died later that year.[5] The film was later dedicated to 
 Scott's memory.[6] Production resumed in 2017 after Kosinski was hired to direct. Principal photography,
 which involved the use of IMAX-certified 6K full-frame cameras, took place from May 2018 to April 2019
 in California, Washington, and Maryland. An initial release date was scheduled for July 12, 2019,
 but it was delayed several times due to the complex action sequences and the COVID-19 pandemic.
 During the pandemic, several streaming companies attempted to purchase the streaming rights
 to the film from Paramount, but all offers were declined on the orders of Cruise,
 who insisted the film be released exclusively in theaters.[7]
